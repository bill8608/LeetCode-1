/*
	Longest Increasing Continuous subsequence Show result 
	Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array)ï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array. (The definition of the longest increasing continuous subsequence here can be from right to left or from left to right)

	Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
	Example
	For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.

	For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.

	Note
	O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
