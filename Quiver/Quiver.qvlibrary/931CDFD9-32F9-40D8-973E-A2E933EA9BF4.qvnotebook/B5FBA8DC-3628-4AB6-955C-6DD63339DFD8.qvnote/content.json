He is a topcoder member and once he learned to master the \"Force\" of dynamic programming, he began solving problem after problem. But his once obedient computer acts quite unfriendly today. Following his usual morning ritual, John woke up at 10 AM, had a cup of coffee and went to solve a problem before breakfast. Something didnâ€™t seem right from the beginning, but based on his vast newly acquired experience, he wrote the algorithm in a flash. Tired of allocating matrices morning after morning, the computer complained:&nbsp;<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: 0px; font-weight: 700;\">\"Segmentation fault!\"</span>. Despite his empty stomach, John has a brilliant idea and gets rid of his beloved matrix by adding an extra \"for cycle\". But the computer cries again:&nbsp;<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: 0px; font-weight: 700;\">\"Time limit exceeded!\"</span></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-bottom: 0px !important;\">Instead of going nuts, John makes a radical decision. Enough programming, he says! He decides to take a vacation as a reward for his hard work.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-bottom: 0px !important;\">Being a very energetic guy, John wants to have the time of his life! With so many things to do, it is unfortunately impossible for him to enjoy them all. So, as soon as he eats his breakfast, he devises a \"Fun Plan\" in which he describes a schedule of his upcoming activities:</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding-bottom: 0px !important;\"><img src=\"quiver-image-url/DAA3E07E2C84AF6B6DE069FB2B52E2BE.jpg\"><br></p>"
