Third Algorithm\n    Averge (Weight Value / Len) Highest Job first:\n        We notice that, even a Job has high weight, if we insert this job, still will get the low value, \n        for example, a content has 10 weight value, but the len of this content is 5, that is mean we only get 2 score per 1 len. \n        On the contrary if another job's weight value is just 4, but the len is 1, that is mean we can get 4 score per 1 len. So I have a idea,           every time we get the content from highest (weight value / len).\n    Highest Location Weight Value First &&: same with above\n    Most Fit Len: same with above\n    \n    Advantages: \n    Disadvantages: "

If there is only one content in a location, can this location still insert content?If yes, there will introduce a issue, we can just              insert all the content to the highest value location, if no suitable interval, just insert to the end of this queue,\n     3.
